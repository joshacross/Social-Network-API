# AfterThought - The Spcial Network API

## Description
AfterThought is a NoSQL Social Network backend built with Mongoose, MongoDB, and Express.js. AfterThought allows users to create various types of Thoughts; from what they are thinking about for the future ("FutureThought"), what is currently on their mind (CurrentThought), and what are their thoughts about things that have happened (AfterThought). 

Plus, users are able to add, update, and delete reactions to other thoughts, as well as adding and removing friends from their friend list.
